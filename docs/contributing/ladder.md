# Contributor Ladder

Within the Kubernetes community, the concept of a contributor ladder has been
developed to define how individuals can earn formal roles within the project.
The Ingate contributor ladder largely follows the [roles defined by the
broader Kubernetes
community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md),
though some aspects are unique to this community.

## Goals

This doc will provide an initial step towards the following goals:

* Ensure the long-term health of the Ingate project and community
* Encourage new contributors to work towards formal roles and responsibilities
* Clearly define the path towards leadership roles
* Develop a strong leadership pipeline, so we have great candidates to fill
 project leadership roles

## Scope

This doc covers the following repositories:

* [kubernetes-sigs/ingate](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingate)

There are opportunities to become an approver or
reviewer for either the entire project or a subset of that project. For
example, you could become a reviewer or approver focused on just docs or
Helm.

## Contributor Ladder Steps

The Ingate contributor ladder has the following steps:

1. Member
2. Reviewer
3. Approver
4. Maintainer

Within Ingate, there are a variety of areas in which one can become a
reviewer or approver, including:

* Documentation
* Helm

## General Guidelines

### Everyone is welcome

We appreciate all contributions, especially non-code contributors such as docs
updates and real-world examples.
You don’t need a formal role in the project to make or review pull requests
and help with issues or discussions. It is entirely optional to accept a formal
role within the project. You must adhere to the
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) while
contributing to the Ingate project.

### These roles require continued contributions

Applying for one of the roles defined above should only be done if you intend to
continue to contribute at a level that would merit that role. If for any reason
If you cannot continue in one of the roles above, please resign. Members
with an extended period away from the project with no activity will be removed
from the Kubernetes GitHub Organizations and will be required to go through the
org membership process again after familiarizing themselves with the current
state of the project.

### Don’t merge without consensus

If you have reason to believe that a change may be contentious, please wait for
additional perspectives from others before merging any PRs. Even if you have
access to merge a PR, it doesn’t mean you should. Although we can’t have PRs
blocked indefinitely, we need to ensure everyone has had a chance to present
their perspective. One of the best ways to resolve issues is to attend the community
meeting and discuss it with maintainers.

### Start a discussion

If you’re interested in working towards one of these roles, please reach out to
an Ingate maintainer on Slack in the
[ingate-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C08EX6HD25B) channel.

## Member, Reviewer, and Approver

The first steps on the contributor ladder are already [clearly defined in the
upstream Kubernetes
Community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#community-membership).
Ingate follows those guidelines along with the rest of the Kubernetes
community.

## Maintainers

The final steps on the contributor ladder represent significant overall leadership
roles within the project. The spaces available for these roles are
limited (generally, 3-4 people in each role is ideal). We ensure that different
companies are represented in these roles wherever possible.

Ingate Maintainers are known as [Subproject
Owners](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#subproject-owner)
within the Kubernetes community. To become an Ingate Maintainer, the most
important things we expect are:

* Long-term, sustained contributions to Ingate for at least 6 months
* Deep understanding of technical goals and direction of the project
* Successfully authored and led significant enhancement proposals
* Approver for at least 3 months
* Ability to lead community meetings

In addition to all the expectations described above, we expect maintainers to
set the technical direction and goals for the project. This role is critical to
the project's health; maintainers should mentor new approvers and
reviewers and ensure healthy processes are in place for discussion
and decision-making. Finally, maintainers are ultimately responsible for
releasing new versions of the controller.
