## Overview

InGate is an Ingress and Gateway API Controller for Kubernetes.

Learn more about [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress) and [Gateway API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway) on the Kubernetes documentation site.

## Get started

## Community, discussion, contribution, and support

While we are in transition, we are still using the Ingress NGINX Slack channels and community meetings.

- Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about setting up your environment, the workflow that we expect, and instructions on the developer certificate of origin that we require.
- Join our Kubernetes Slack channel for developer discussion: [#ingate-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C08EX6HD25B).
- Submit GitHub issues for any feature enhancements, bugs, or documentation problems.
- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingate/discussions) for ideas, announcements and other general topics folks would like to help direct the project.

### Code of conduct

Participation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
