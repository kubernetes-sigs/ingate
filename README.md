# InGate

> [!CAUTION]
> InGate is being retired (early 2026).
> SIG Network and the Security Response Committee recommend that all users begin migration to Gateway API or another Ingress controller immediately. Many options are listed in the Kubernetes documentation: [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/) and [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/). Additional options may be available from vendors you work with.

## Overview
